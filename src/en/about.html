        <p class="text1">Our employees are hired through our specialized training centers in aircraft sales in Paris and are directly transferred to one of our 70 companies across the country.
            They are recognized for having a "Master in Sales and Product Expertise for Market Sales" certification recognized by the State and have particularly relevant experience thanks to our mandatory forums on "The Advancement of the Aviation Sector with Tomorrow's Technology".
            In addition, we offer future employees interested in our company a 6-month initiation internship, allowing them to join one of our teams directly after, depending on their results and progress.
            Of course, our employees are regularly trained due to the advancement of aviation laws and new technologies, and have the opportunity to be promoted to higher sought-after positions if they wish.

        <p class="Fur">FURKAN Solutions is a company created in 0, dealing with the sale of aircraft for our partners and individuals on a temporary basis. Our company was first founded in Ardèche after Marius Rapanakis-Bourg and Mathis Fautsch, founders and directors of FURKAN Solutions, made a first agreement with DASSAULT, then it expanded with the help of François Dargentolle, former treasurer at McDonald's and now co-director of FURKAN Solutions.
            Our company is based on cooperation and trust established with our partners, but it is also based on the experience of our employees and the expertise they bring.
            This company has faced many perils and obstacles, whether it be material inflation or mass job cuts, but our company remains among the top 20 aircraft sales companies in the world.
            In addition, our company received 10 consecutive awards at the aviation Oscars from 2001 to 2011, further demonstrating our seriousness and experience in the field.
